LOMOPTIM (Life of Mine Optimizer): An Implementation of Lerchs-Grossman Algorithm for Open Pit Mines with Sub-Optimal Conditions

## Objectives

- Make an alternative program for Whittle, a strategic mine planning software used in determining the optimized economics of open pit mines with existing limitations.
- Implement the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm while considering sub-optimal conditions such as :
    1. an annual mining production minimum per product (e.g. 1M wmt limonite)
    2. maximum number of open areas (non-mined-out active areas in hectares) per year
- Output the optimum annual production (tonnages and quality per product, NPV) in tabular format (csv), along with the annual pit shells in PLY format
